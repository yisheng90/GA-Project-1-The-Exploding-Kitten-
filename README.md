## Getting Started
1. Clone the Repo
2. Open index.html
3. Have Fun


### How to Use

#### Rules


1.Play a card from your hand by placing it FACE UP on top of the Discard Pile, and following the instructions on the card. Or play no cards at all; that's cool too.

2.After you follow the instructions on a card, you can play more cards. You can play as many cards as you'd like.

3.Finally, end your turn by drawing a card from the Draw Pile into your hand and hoping it's not an Exploding Kitten.


#### Cards type


* Exploding Kitten: Unless you have a DEFUSE CARD, you're dead.
* Attack: End your turn(s) without drawing and force the next player to take 2 turns in a row. (If the victim of an ATTACK CARD plays an ATTACK CARD, their turns are immediately over, and the next player must take 2 turns.)
* Skip: Immediately end your turn without drawing a card. If you play a SKIP CARD as a defense against an ATTACK CARD, it only ends one of the two turns. Two SKIP CARDS would end both turns.
* Favor: Force any other player to give you 1 card from their hand. The cards is randomly assigned.
* Shuffle: Shuffle the Draw Pile without viewing the cards until told to stop. (Useful when you know there's an EXPLODING KITTEN coming.)
* See The Future: Peek at the top 3 cards from the Draw Pile.
* Draw From Bottom: Draw a card from the bottom of Draw Pile.
* Defuse: Save yourself from exploding.
